# Practice converting user input to numeric data types and perform calculations.

# Write a program that does the following:

# Prompt the user for their age. Convert it to a number, add one to it, and tell them how old they will be on their next birthday.

# Prompt the user for the number of egg cartons they have. Assume each carton holds 12 eggs, multiply their number by 12, and display 
# the total number of eggs.

# Prompt the user for a number of cookies and a number of people. Then, divide the number of cookies by the number of people to determine 
# how many cookies each person gets.

#QUESTION 1
# age = input("Please enter you age here:")
# user_age = int(age)
# next_birthday = user_age + 1
# output = (f"You'll be {next_birthday} on your next birthday")
# print(output)

#QUESTION 2
# egg_cartons = input("How many cartons of eggs do you have?:")
# total_eggs = int(egg_cartons)*12
# output = (f"Total number of eggs are {total_eggs}")
# print(output)

#QUESTION 3
# amt_cookies = input("Please enter number of cookies:")
# num_people = input("Please enter number of people left:")
# each_gets = float(amt_cookies)/float(num_people)
# output = (f"Each person gets {each_gets} amount of cookie")
# print(output)
